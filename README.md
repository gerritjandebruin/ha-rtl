If you want to integrate the KaKu ACDB-7000A, use the folloing config file:
```
# This is an empty template for configuring rtl_433. mqtt information will be
# automatically added. Create multiple files ending in '.conf.template' to
# manage multiple rtl_433 radios, being sure to set the 'device' setting.
# https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433/blob/master/conf/rtl_433.example.conf

***********************

A Home Assistant addon for a software defined radio tuned to listen for RF transmissions and convert them into [device triggers](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/device_trigger.mqtt/).
This device trigger can be used to trigger any automation as soon as a specific message is received.
For example, the add-on allows to integrate the [KAKU ACDB-7000A](https://klikaanklikuit.nl/product/draadloze-drukknop/) to be used in Home Assistant.
Setup is done automatically via [MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/).

This hass.io addon is based on https://hub.docker.com/r/hertzg/rtl_433, which is based on the well-known rtl_433 library (https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433).
Compared to https://github.com/pbkhrv/rtl_433-hass-addons, this add-on has a few differences:
- Configuration is done via the configuration tab of the addon.
- In default mode, logging is done via the logging tab of the addon.
- The addon is a [pre-built container](https://hub.docker.com/u/gerritjandebruin), allowing much faster installation.
- This addon provides currently only device_triggers, which are well suited for buttons, remote controls, etc.

If anything does not work, or you have trouble using your own RF device, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/gerritjandebruin/doorbell/issues).

## Usage

1) Install the addon by adding the repository https://github.com/gerritjandebruin/ha-rtl in the add-on store. Or use this button:
[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgerritjandebruin%2Fha-rtl)

2) Connect to a USB RTL-SDR Dongle supported by [rtl_433](https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433). For example [this](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/32476877972.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.70924c4d9vmXSr) item.

3) Use addon configuration to configure the following options (all are optional) for each device:
- protocol (=device, look [here](https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433))
- automation_type (only device_automation supported at this time)
- trigger_type
- trigger_subtype
- manufacturer
- frequency
- manufacturer
- name
- id (=house code, see below)
- model

4) Start the addon.

## ID/ house code
The addon will log any pulse received.
When home assistant should only respond to your specific device, set the id option for the device.
This id can be found by looking to the logs, where it is reported as `house code'.

## Hardware

This has been tested and used with the following hardware:
- KAKU ACDB-7000A (https://www.gamma.nl/assortiment/klikaanklikuit-deurbel-set-acdb-6600ac/p/B413295)  
- cheap rtl receiver ([aliexpress.com](https://aliexpress.com/item/32476877972.html))
- HASS.IO on old laptop, see https://github.com/gerritjandebruin/home-assistant

Total costs: +- â‚¬35, including chime and doorbell that work also when HA is down.

## Automations
To use this device in automations, please make use of the visual editor and choose under trigger for "Device".
You should see your device as soon as the add-on starts.

In my case, I create a notification for every device that the doorbell rang, see https://github.com/gerritjandebruin/home-assistant/blob/a1145e7b9ec0b38e20aaa4893a0365a1e106976e/automations.yaml#L248.
