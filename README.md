# RTL433 to MQTT Bridge hass.io addon
A hass.io addon for a software defined radio tuned to listen for 433MHz RF transmissions and republish the data via MQTT

This hass.io addon is based on https://github.com/james-fry/hassio-addons/tree/master/rtl4332mqtt, which is in turn based on Chris Kacerguis' project here: https://github.com/chriskacerguis/honeywell2mqtt,
which is in turn based on Marco Verleun's rtl2mqtt image here: https://github.com/roflmao/rtl2mqtt

Modified by Gerrit-Jan de Bruin to work specifically for the KAKU ACDB-7000A (https://klikaanklikuit.nl/product/draadloze-drukknop/).

## Usage

1) Install the addon: `git clone https://github.com/gerritjandebruin/home-assistant-kaku-doorbell.git /addons` or by Supervisor -> Add-on Store -> Options -> Repositories -> Add https://github.com/gerritjandebruin/home-assistant-kaku-doorbell.git.

2) Use addon configuration to configure:
- mqtt_host (default localhost)
- mqtt_user
- mqtt_password
- mqtt_topic (default homeassistant/sensor/doorbell)
- protocol (see https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433 for more details inc protocol IDs, default 96)
- deviceid (Will only respond to this specific device id. Obtain this id by running the add-on, activate your device and look to the add-on logs.)

3) This add-on uses MQTT auto-discovery, to set up a device trigger (https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/device_trigger.mqtt/)

## Hardware

This has been tested and used with the following hardware:
- KAKU ACDB-7000A (https://www.gamma.nl/assortiment/klikaanklikuit-deurbel-set-acdb-6600ac/p/B413295)  
- cheap rtl receiver ([aliexpress.com](https://aliexpress.com/item/32476877972.html))
- HASS.IO on old laptop, see https://github.com/gerritjandebruin/home-assistant

Total costs: +- â‚¬35, including chime and doorbell.
Beat that Ring! (And this is way more privacy friendly.)

## Automations
To use this device in automations, please make use of the visual editor and choose under trigger for "Device".
You should see your device as soon as the add-on starts.

In my case, I create a notification for every device that the doorbell rang, see https://github.com/gerritjandebruin/home-assistant/blob/a1145e7b9ec0b38e20aaa4893a0365a1e106976e/automations.yaml#L248.
